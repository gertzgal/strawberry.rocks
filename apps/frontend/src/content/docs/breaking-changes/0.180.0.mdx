# v0.180.0 introduces a breaking change for the Django Channels HTTP integration

The context object is now a `dict`. This means that you should access the
context value using the `[&quot;key&quot;]` syntax instead of the `.key` syntax.

For the HTTP integration, there is also no `ws` key anymore and `request` is a
custom request object containing the full request instead of a
`GraphQLHTTPConsumer` instance. If you need to access the `GraphQLHTTPConsumer`
instance in a HTTP connection, you can access it via
`info.context[&quot;request&quot;].consumer`.

For the WebSockets integration, the context keys did not change, e.g. the values
for `info.context[&quot;ws&quot;]`, `info.context[&quot;request&quot;]` and
`info.context[&quot;connection_params&quot;]` are the same as before.

If you still want to use the `.key` syntax, you can override `get_context()` to
return a custom dataclass there. See the Channels integration documentation for
an example.
